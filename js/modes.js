/* SOL Labyrinth v5.8.5 — shooter levels.
 *
 * Every other level of each realm (levels 2, 4, 6 and 8) swaps the maze for a
 * shooter, in rotation:
 *   2  Eagle Swoop   galaga style: eagles carry the letters above a raven guard and dive; shoot the right eagle
 *   4  Rune Rocks    asteroids style: beam in the rock with the right letter, blast the rest
 *   6  Sun Chariot   side-scrolling flyer: shoot the letter orb with the right answer
 *   8  Wolf Ring     arena: Hati attack; runestones rise one or two at a time; shoot the right one while it is up
 * Odd levels stay in the maze and every tenth level is still Fenrir's boss maze.
 * v5.12 (from the Chemistry build), Virginia and New Jersey: a fifth shooter, Root Worms (centipede
 * style: shoot the glowing worm segment with the right letter), shares those four slots. The order
 * raid, rocks, sky, ring, worms turns one place every realm, so each shooter plays in four realms
 * out of five; the first realm keeps 2 raid, 4 rocks, 6 sky, 8 ring (modeAt). Eagle Swoop's rows are
 * new birds realm by realm (BIRDS, raidKindsFor) and never refill. And the teacher's rule: in Eagle
 * Swoop and Root Worms the last answer doesn't end the level — the student shoots down what is
 * left first (mopup_<id>, mopupLeft, mopupDone).
 * v5.10, the Odyssey build only (window.SOL_STATE === "ODY"): level 9 of every island is
 *   9  Scylla and Charybdis  steering level: sail through the gate with the right letter while
 *                            Charybdis's whirlpool pulls and Scylla's heads strike (v5.12.4: reefs of sea
 *                            stacks between the gates, and after the last answer the run to the end of the
 *                            strait, mopup_strait)
 *
 * The questions, the reading pop-up, lives, coins, the adaptive reading level,
 * the castle perks and the end-of-level screens are the maze's own: ModeScene
 * extends NightScene and only replaces the playfield. A wrong letter costs a life
 * and so does getting hit, the same as a wrong letter or a catch in the maze.
 *
 * game.js calls SolModes.install(NightScene, internals) after SolRealms.install
 * and switches scenes in restartNight(). Load order: after realms.js, before game.js.

     the water to the lower right. A lettered stack carries a worn, painted marker stone on its top (the letter is a

      /* ── v5.12: clearing the field after the last answer (the teacher's rule for Eagle Swoop and Root Worms).
         answerPick calls mopup_<id>() on the level's last answer instead of clear_<id>(). It takes the letters off
         what is left and returns how many are left (0: the level is won as before); from then on the mode's tick reports how many are left
         with mopupLeft(n), and 0 wins the level (mopupDone, then the usual end-of-level screen and coins). Nothing new
         flies in, hazards keep going, a hit still costs a life and losing the last life still loses the level.
         v5.12.4: Scylla and Charybdis uses it too (mopup_strait: the run to the end of the strait). A mode can say it
         in its own words: mode.clear.tag / done / sweep (the big tags and the clean-sweep bonus)

      /* ═══ 5. ROOT WORMS — centipede (v5.12, from the Chemistry build) ═════
         Nidhogg's worms wind down a mushroom field one row at a time, turning
         at every mushroom, like Centipede. A few segments of the lead worm glow
         with a letter; the right one answers. A plain segment shot becomes a
         mushroom and splits the worm. Sol walks in the clearing at the bottom
         with one arrow in the air at a time. Wolf = the spider, raven = the
         flea, wisp = the scorpion (it poisons mushrooms). wormsParams sets one
         curve, harder at every level. So that a question can never get stuck
         (fixes to the Chemistry code): a worm, or a piece split off one, that
         is still off the edge always walks onto the field; a worm that bites
         Sol never loses a glowing segment; an arrow can't skip over a mushroom
         on a slow frame; and a watchdog lays the letters out on a fresh worm
         should one ever go missing all the same. After the last answer every
         segment left has to be shot (mopup_worms); a worm still up in the
         field 15 s later plunges down into the clearing. Virginia and New
         Jersey only (MODES.worms.noOdy). */

      /* ═══ 6. SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS — steering (v5.10, the Odyssey build) ════
         Odyssey 12: the galley sails up the strait (the water scrolls down the
         screen toward it). Gates of two sea stacks come down, each marked
         with a letter; sailing between a gate's stacks picks that letter. A
         lettered row holds one to three gates with open water beside them, so
         a gate can be passed by; its letter comes round again in a later row.
         On the right, Charybdis: a whirlpool that tugs at the ship, and every
         few seconds darkens and spins faster for about a second, then surges
         and drags the ship toward her; her dark centre costs a life. On the
         left, Scylla's cliff: a shadow and a closing ring on the water mark
         where a head will strike, then the head lunges there and snatches a
         crewman (a life) if the ship is under it. Scylla's reach ends partway
         across the strait, so the safe water is next to Charybdis — Circe's
         choice. A wrong gate or a rock also cost a life. straitParams sets one
         curve for all of it.
         v5.12.4, the teacher: "the rocks look like a slalom", "too easy", "over
         too quickly", "the path is too wide". Every rock is a big sea stack
         (drawPillar, STACK) and what is drawn is what hurts (straitRockHit).
         The strait between Scylla's cliff and Charybdis is about half the
         playfield. Between two lettered rows come P.plain reefs: a row of
         stacks from the cliff to Charybdis with one or two gaps to steer
         through (straitReefRow). And the last answer no longer ends the level
         (mopup_strait): the galley still has to run the rest of the strait,
         P.mopRows more reefs, counted down as each one passes the ship. */
